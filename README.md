# Password-Generator

## Description 

Everybody needs to be able to secure the things in their life that are important to them. Some people have their passwords they've used for years and years and we're given instructions on things a "good" password should have included in it but many people don't actually use a password generator, they just use the same passwords that have those same parameters. 

What I have created is a password generator that allows you to completely randomize a total character set of the most common 69 lower and upper characters, special characters and numbers in order to make a truly secure password for anything from your Facebook account to your financial institutions.

## Usage 

To start generating your password, you will need to choose: 

1. Length of password
2. Whether you want:
    *Special Characters
    *Uppercase Letters
    *Lowercase Letters
    *Numbers

The password will then be displayed in the text box and you can select and copy it wherever you would like.
